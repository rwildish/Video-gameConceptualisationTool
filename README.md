# Video-gameConceptualisationTool

Before hitting generate or changing any options within the two UI menus
it is imperative that the user deletes the GameObjects that are obviously not
supposed to be on the screen at the time. This includes any assets that may
have been generated by the tool. Which would include objects like trees, houses,
roads, etc. DO NOT delete Map Generator, Mesh, Plane or Options objects as this
will likely involve re-downloading the repo.
